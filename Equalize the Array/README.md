Equalize the Array

Karl has an array of integers. He wants to reduce the array until all remaining elements are equal. Determine the minimum number of elements to delete to reach his goal.

For example, if his array is arr=[1,2,2,3], we see that he can delete the 2 elements 1 and 3 leaving arr=[2,2. He could also delete both twos and either the 1 or the 3, but that would take 3 deletions. The minimum number of deletions is 2.

Function Description

Complete the equalizeArray function in the editor below. It must return an integer that denotes the minimum number of deletions required.
equalizeArray has the following parameter(s): arr: an array of integers

Input Format
The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in arr.
The next line contains n space-separated integers arr[i].

Constraints
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= arr[i] <=100
 
Output Format
Print a single integer that denotes the minimum number of elements Karl must delete for all elements in the array to be equal.
  
Sample Input
5
33213

Sample Output
2

Explanation
Array arr = [3,3,2,1,3]. If we delete arr[2] = 2 and arr[3]=1, all of the the elements in the resulting array, A' = [3,3,3], will be equal. Deleting these 2 elements is minimal. Our only other options would be to delete 4 elements
