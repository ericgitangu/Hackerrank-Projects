Given a large integer, n , use the Java BigInteger class' isProbablePrime method to determine and print whether it's prime or not prime.

Input Format
A single line containing an integer, n (the number to be checked).

Constraints
n contains at most  digits.

Output Format
If n is a prime number, print prime; otherwise, print not prime.

Sample Input
13

Sample Output
prime
